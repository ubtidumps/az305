   Case Study -
   <br/>
   This is a case study. Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you
                    would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this
                    exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on
                    this exam in the time provided.
   <br/>
   To answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is
                    provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide
                    more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is
                    independent of the other questions in this case study.
   <br/>
   At the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your
                    answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new
                    section, you cannot return to this section.

   Litware has 10 Azure subscriptions that are linked to the Litware.com tenant and five Azure
                    subscriptions that are linked to the dev.litware.com tenant. All the subscriptions are in an
                    Enterprise Agreement (EA).
   <br/>
   The litware.com tenant contains a custom Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) role named
                    Role1 that grants the DataActions read permission to the blobs and files in Azure Storage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On-Premises Environment -
   <br/>
   The on-premises network of Litware contains the resources shown in the following table.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   Overview -
   <br/>
   Fabrikam, Inc. is an engineering company that has offices throughout Europe. The company has a main
                    office in London and three branch offices in Amsterdam,
   <br/>
   Berlin, and Rome.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment: Active Directory Environment
   <br/>
   The network contains two Active Directory forests named corp.fabrikam.com and rd.fabrikam.com. There
                    are no trust relationships between the forests.
   <br/>
   Corp.fabrikam.com is a production forest that contains identities used for internal user and
                    computer authentication.
   <br/>
   Rd.fabrikam.com is used by the research and development (R&amp;D) department only. The R&amp;D
                    department is restricted to using on-premises resources only.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment: Network Infrastructure
   <br/>
   Each office contains at least one domain controller from the corp.fabrikam.com domain. The main
                    office contains all the domain controllers for the rd.fabrikam.com forest.
   <br/>
   All the offices have a high-speed connection to the internet.
   <br/>
   An existing application named WebApp1 is hosted in the data center of the London office. WebApp1 is
                    used by customers to place and track orders. WebApp1 has a web tier that uses Microsoft Internet
                    information Services (IIS) and a database tier that runs Microsoft SQL Server 2016. The web tier and
                    the database tier are deployed to virtual machines that run on Hyper-V.
   <br/>
   The IT department currently uses a separate Hyper-V environment to test updates to WebApp1.
   <br/>
   Fabrikam purchases all Microsoft licenses through a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement that includes
                    Software Assurance.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment: Problem Statements
   <br/>
   The use of WebApp1 is unpredictable. At peak times, users often report delays. At other times, many
                    resources for WebApp1 are underutilized.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Requirements: Planned Changes -
   <br/>
   Fabrikam plans to move most of its production workloads to Azure during the next few years,
                    including virtual machines that rely on Active Directory for authentication.
   <br/>
   As one of its first projects, the company plans to establish a hybrid identity model, facilitating
                    an upcoming Microsoft 365 deployment.
   <br/>
   All R&amp;D operations will remain on-premises.
   <br/>
   Fabrikam plans to migrate the production and test instances of WebApp1 to Azure.
   <br/>
   Requirements: Technical Requirements
   <br/>
   Fabrikam identifies the following technical requirements:
   <br/>
   Website content must be easily updated from a single point.
   <br/>
   User input must be minimized when provisioning new web app instances.
   <br/>
   Whenever possible, existing on-premises licenses must be used to reduce cost.
   <br/>
   Users must always authenticate by using their corp.fabrikam.com UPN identity.
   <br/>
   Any new deployments to Azure must be redundant in case an Azure region fails.
   <br/>
   Whenever possible, solutions must be deployed to Azure by using the Standard pricing tier of Azure
                    App Service.
   <br/>
   An email distribution group named IT Support must be notified of any issues relating to the
                    directory synchronization services.
   <br/>
   In the event that a link fails between Azure and the on-premises network, ensure that the virtual
                    machines hosted in Azure can authenticate to Active Directory.
   <br/>
   Directory synchronization between Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and corp.fabrikam.com must not
                    be affected by a link failure between Azure and the on- premises network.
   <br/>
   Requirements: Database Requirements
   <br/>
   Fabrikam identifies the following database requirements:
   <br/>
   Database metrics for the production instance of WebApp1 must be available for analysis so that
                    database administrators can optimize the performance settings.
   <br/>
   To avoid disrupting customer access, database downtime must be minimized when databases are
                    migrated.
   <br/>
   Database backups must be retained for a minimum of seven years to meet compliance requirements.
   <br/>
   Requirements: Security Requirements
   <br/>
   Fabrikam identifies the following security requirements:
   <br/>
   Company information including policies, templates, and data must be inaccessible to anyone outside
                    the company.
   <br/>
   Users on the on-premises network must be able to authenticate to corp.fabrikam.com if an internet
                    link fails.
   <br/>
   Administrators must be able authenticate to the Azure portal by using their corp.fabrikam.com
                    credentials.
   <br/>
   All administrative access to the Azure portal must be secured by using multi-factor authentication
                    (MFA).
   <br/>
   The testing of WebApp1 updates must not be visible to anyone outside the company.

   <br/>
   Existing Environment: Technical Environment
   <br/>
   The on-premises network contains a single Active Directory domain named contoso.com.
   <br/>
   Contoso has a single Azure subscription.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment: Business Partnerships
   <br/>
   Contoso has a business partnership with Fabrikam, Inc. Fabrikam users access some Contoso
                    applications over the internet by using Azure Active Directory
   <br/>
   (Azure AD) guest accounts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Requirements: Planned Changes -
   <br/>
   Contoso plans to deploy two applications named App1 and App2 to Azure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Requirements: App1 -
   <br/>
   App1 will be a Python web app hosted in Azure App Service that requires a Linux runtime. Users from
                    Contoso and Fabrikam will access App1.
   <br/>
   App1 will access several services that require third-party credentials and access strings. The
                    credentials and access strings are stored in Azure Key Vault.
   <br/>
   App1 will have six instances: three in the East US Azure region and three in the West Europe Azure
                    region.
   <br/>
   App1 has the following data requirements:
   <br/>
   Each instance will write data to a data store in the same availability zone as the instance.
   <br/>
   Data written by any App1 instance must be visible to all App1 instances.
   <br/>
   App1 will only be accessible from the internet. App1 has the following connection requirements:
   <br/>
   Connections to App1 must pass through a web application firewall (WAF).
   <br/>
   Connections to App1 must be active-active load balanced between instances.
   <br/>
   All connections to App1 from North America must be directed to the East US region. All other
                    connections must be directed to the West Europe region.
   <br/>
   Every hour, you will run a maintenance task by invoking a PowerShell script that copies files from
                    all the App1 instances. The PowerShell script will run from a central location.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Requirements: App2 -
   <br/>
   App2 will be a NET app hosted in App Service that requires a Windows runtime. App2 has the following
                    file storage requirements:
   <br/>
   Save files to an Azure Storage account.
   <br/>
   Replicate files to an on-premises location.
   <br/>
   Ensure that on-premises clients can read the files over the LAN by using the SMB protocol.
   <br/>
   You need to monitor App2 to analyze how long it takes to perform different transactions within the
                    application. The solution must not require changes to the application code.
   <br/>
   Application Development Requirements
   <br/>
   Application developers will constantly develop new versions of App1 and App2. The development
                    process must meet the following requirements:
   <br/>
   A staging instance of a new application version must be deployed to the application host before the
                    new version is used in production.
   <br/>
   After testing the new version, the staging version of the application will replace the production
                    version.
   <br/>
   The switch to the new application version from staging to production must occur without any downtime
                    of the application.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Identity Requirements -
   <br/>
   Contoso identifies the following requirements for managing Fabrikam access to resources:
   <br/>
   Every month, an account manager at Fabrikam must review which Fabrikam users have access permissions
                    to App1. Accounts that no longer need permissions must be removed as guests.
   <br/>
   The solution must minimize development effort.
   <br/>
   <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04082/0001000013.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Security Requirement -
   <br/>
   All secrets used by Azure services must be stored in Azure Key Vault.
   <br/>
   Services that require credentials must have the credentials tied to the service instance. The
                    credentials must NOT be shared between services.

    Requirements: Identity Requirements
    <br/>
    Contoso identifies the following requirements for managing Fabrikam access to resources:
    <br/>
    ‚úë Every month, an account manager at Fabrikam must review which Fabrikam users have access
                        permissions to App1. Accounts that no longer need permissions must be removed as guests.

    <br/>
    Box 1: The Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
    <br/>
    When should you use access reviews?
    <br/>
    Too many users in privileged roles: It's a good idea to check how many users have administrative
                        access, how many of them are Global Administrators, and if
    <br/>
    <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04082/0001200004.png"/>
    there are any invited guests or partners that have not been removed after being assigned to do
                        an administrative task. You can recertify the role assignment users in Azure AD roles such as
                        Global Administrators, or Azure resources roles such as User Access Administrator in the Azure
                        AD Privileged Identity
    <br/>
    Management (PIM) experience.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Box 2: Access reviews -
    <br/>
    Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) access reviews enable organizations to efficiently manage
                        group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments. User's access can be
                        reviewed on a regular basis to make sure only the right people have continued access.

    Scenario: App1 has the following data requirements:
    <br/>
    ‚úë Each instance will write data to a data store in the same availability zone as the instance.
    <br/>
    ‚úë Data written by any App1 instance must be visible to all App1 instances.
    <br/>
    Azure Cosmos DB: Each partition across all the regions is replicated. Each region contains all
                        the data partitions of an Azure Cosmos container and can serve reads as well as serve writes
                        when multi-region writes is enabled.
    <br/>
    Incorrect Answers:
    <br/>
    B, D: GZRS protects against failures. Geo-redundant storage (with GRS or GZRS) replicates your
                        data to another physical location in the secondary region to protect against regional outages.
                        However, that data is available to be read only if the customer or Microsoft initiates a
                        failover from the primary to secondary region.
    <br/>
    C: Active geo-replication is designed as a business continuity solution that lets you perform
                        quick disaster recovery of individual databases in case of a regional disaster or a large scale
                        outage. Once geo-replication is set up, you can initiate a geo-failover to a geo-secondary in a
                        different Azure region. The geo-failover is initiated programmatically by the application or
                        manually by the user.

    Box 1: SQL Managed Instance -
    <br/>
    Scenario: Once migrated to Azure, DB1 and DB2 must meet the following requirements:
    <br/>
    ‚úë Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail.
    <br/>
    ‚úë Fail over automatically.
    <br/>
    ‚úë Minimize I/O latency.
    <br/>
    The auto-failover groups feature allows you to manage the replication and failover of a group of
                        databases on a server or all databases in a managed instance to another region. It is a
                        declarative abstraction on top of the existing active geo-replication feature, designed to
                        simplify deployment and management of geo- replicated databases at scale. You can initiate a
                        geo-failover manually or you can delegate it to the Azure service based on a user-defined
                        policy. The latter option allows you to automatically recover multiple related databases in a
                        secondary region after a catastrophic failure or other unplanned event that results in full or
                        partial loss of the SQL Database or SQL Managed Instance availability in the primary region.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Box 2: Business critical -
    <br/>
    SQL Managed Instance is available in two service tiers:
    <br/>
    General purpose: Designed for applications with typical performance and I/O latency
                        requirements.
    <br/>
    Business critical: Designed for applications with low I/O latency requirements and minimal
                        impact of underlying maintenance operations on the workload.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   Existing Environment -
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Technical Environment -
   <br/>
   The on-premises network contains a single Active Directory domain named contoso.com.
   <br/>
   Contoso has a single Azure subscription.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Business Partnerships -
   <br/>
   Contoso has a business partnership with Fabrikam, Inc. Fabrikam users access some Contoso
                    applications over the internet by using Azure Active Directory
   <br/>
   (Azure AD) guest accounts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Requirements -
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Planned Changes -
   <br/>
   Contoso plans to deploy two applications named App1 and App2 to Azure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   App1 -
   <br/>
   App1 will be a Python web app hosted in Azure App Service that requires a Linux runtime. Users from
                    Contoso and Fabrikam will access App1.
   <br/>
   App1 will access several services that require third-party credentials and access strings. The
                    credentials and access strings are stored in Azure Key Vault.
   <br/>
   App1 will have six instances: three in the East US Azure region and three in the West Europe Azure
                    region.
   <br/>
   App1 has the following data requirements:
   <br/>
   Each instance will write data to a data store in the same availability zone as the instance.
   <br/>
   Data written by any App1 instance must be visible to all App1 instances.
   <br/>
   App1 will only be accessible from the internet. App1 has the following connection requirements:
   <br/>
   Connections to App1 must pass through a web application firewall (WAF).
   <br/>
   Connections to App1 must be active-active load balanced between instances.
   <br/>
   All connections to App1 from North America must be directed to the East US region. All other
                    connections must be directed to the West Europe region.
   <br/>
   Every hour, you will run a maintenance task by invoking a PowerShell script that copies files from
                    all the App1 instances. The PowerShell script will run from a central location.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   App2 -
   <br/>
   App2 will be a NET app hosted in App Service that requires a Windows runtime. App2 has the following
                    file storage requirements:
   <br/>
   Save files to an Azure Storage account.
   <br/>
   Replicate files to an on-premises location.
   <br/>
   Ensure that on-premises clients can read the files over the LAN by using the SMB protocol.
   <br/>
   You need to monitor App2 to analyze how long it takes to perform different transactions within the
                    application. The solution must not require changes to the application code.
   <br/>
   Application Development Requirements
   <br/>
   Application developers will constantly develop new versions of App1 and App2. The development
                    process must meet the following requirements:
   <br/>
   A staging instance of a new application version must be deployed to the application host before the
                    new version is used in production.
   <br/>
   After testing the new version, the staging version of the application will replace the production
                    version.
   <br/>
   The switch to the new application version from staging to production must occur without any downtime
                    of the application.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Identity Requirements -
   <br/>
   Contoso identifies the following requirements for managing Fabrikam access to resources:
   <br/>
   Every month, an account manager at Fabrikam must review which Fabrikam users have access permissions
                    to App1. Accounts that no longer need permissions must be removed as guests.
   <br/>
   The solution must minimize development effort.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Security Requirement -
   <br/>
   All secrets used by Azure services must be stored in Azure Key Vault.
   <br/>
   Services that require credentials must have the credentials tied to the service instance. The
                    credentials must NOT be shared between services.
   <span class="inquestion-subtitle mb-0 mt-3">
    Question
   </span>
   HOTSPOT -
   <br/>
   You need to recommend a solution to ensure that App1 can access the third-party credentials and
                    access strings. The solution must meet the security requirements.
   <br/>
   What should you include in the recommendation? To answer, select the appropriate options in the
                    answer area.
   <br/>
   NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

                        which is to say, a piece of code rather than a user or group. A service principal's object ID is
                        known as its client ID and acts like its username. The service principal's client secret acts
                        like its password.
    <br/>
    Note: Authentication with Key Vault works in conjunction with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD),
                        which is responsible for authenticating the identity of any given security principal.
    <br/>
    A security principal is an object that represents a user, group, service, or application that's
                        requesting access to Azure resources. Azure assigns a unique object
    <br/>
    ID to every security principal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Box 2: A role assignment -
    <br/>
    You can provide access to Key Vault keys, certificates, and secrets with an Azure role-based
                        access control.

   <br/>
   Overview -
   <br/>
   Fabrikam, Inc. is an engineering company that has offices throughout Europe. The company has a main
                    office in London and three branch offices in Amsterdam,
   <br/>
   Berlin, and Rome.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment: Active Directory Environment
   <br/>
   The network contains two Active Directory forests named corp.fabrikam.com and rd.fabrikam.com. There
                    are no trust relationships between the forests.
   <br/>
   Corp.fabrikam.com is a production forest that contains identities used for internal user and
                    computer authentication.
   <br/>
   Rd.fabrikam.com is used by the research and development (R&amp;D) department only. The R&amp;D
                    department is restricted to using on-premises resources only.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment: Network Infrastructure
   <br/>
   Each office contains at least one domain controller from the corp.fabrikam.com domain. The main
                    office contains all the domain controllers for the rd.fabrikam.com forest.
   <br/>
   All the offices have a high-speed connection to the internet.
   <br/>
   An existing application named WebApp1 is hosted in the data center of the London office. WebApp1 is
                    used by customers to place and track orders. WebApp1 has a web tier that uses Microsoft Internet
                    information Services (IIS) and a database tier that runs Microsoft SQL Server 2016. The web tier and
                    the database tier are deployed to virtual machines that run on Hyper-V.
   <br/>
   The IT department currently uses a separate Hyper-V environment to test updates to WebApp1.
   <br/>
   Fabrikam purchases all Microsoft licenses through a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement that includes
                    Software Assurance.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment: Problem Statements
   <br/>
   The use of WebApp1 is unpredictable. At peak times, users often report delays. At other times, many
                    resources for WebApp1 are underutilized.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Requirements: Planned Changes -
   <br/>
   Fabrikam plans to move most of its production workloads to Azure during the next few years,
                    including virtual machines that rely on Active Directory for authentication.
   <br/>
   As one of its first projects, the company plans to establish a hybrid identity model, facilitating
                    an upcoming Microsoft 365 deployment.
   <br/>
   All R&amp;D operations will remain on-premises.
   <br/>
   Fabrikam plans to migrate the production and test instances of WebApp1 to Azure.
   <br/>
   Requirements: Technical Requirements
   <br/>
   Fabrikam identifies the following technical requirements:
   <br/>
   Website content must be easily updated from a single point.
   <br/>
   User input must be minimized when provisioning new web app instances.
   <br/>
   Whenever possible, existing on-premises licenses must be used to reduce cost.
   <br/>
   Users must always authenticate by using their corp.fabrikam.com UPN identity.
   <br/>
   Any new deployments to Azure must be redundant in case an Azure region fails.
   <br/>
   Whenever possible, solutions must be deployed to Azure by using the Standard pricing tier of Azure
                    App Service.
   <br/>
   An email distribution group named IT Support must be notified of any issues relating to the
                    directory synchronization services.
   <br/>
   In the event that a link fails between Azure and the on-premises network, ensure that the virtual
                    machines hosted in Azure can authenticate to Active Directory.
   <br/>
   Directory synchronization between Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and corp.fabrikam.com must not
                    be affected by a link failure between Azure and the on- premises network.
   <br/>
   Requirements: Database Requirements
   <br/>
   Fabrikam identifies the following database requirements:
   <br/>
   Database metrics for the production instance of WebApp1 must be available for analysis so that
                    database administrators can optimize the performance settings.
   <br/>
   To avoid disrupting customer access, database downtime must be minimized when databases are
                    migrated.
   <br/>
   Database backups must be retained for a minimum of seven years to meet compliance requirements.
   <br/>
   Requirements: Security Requirements
   <br/>
   Fabrikam identifies the following security requirements:
   <br/>
   Company information including policies, templates, and data must be inaccessible to anyone outside
                    the company.
   <br/>
   Users on the on-premises network must be able to authenticate to corp.fabrikam.com if an internet
                    link fails.
   <br/>
   Administrators must be able authenticate to the Azure portal by using their corp.fabrikam.com
                    credentials.
   <br/>
   All administrative access to the Azure portal must be secured by using multi-factor authentication
                    (MFA).
   <br/>
   The testing of WebApp1 updates must not be visible to anyone outside the company.

   <br/>
   On-Premises Environment -
   <br/>
   The on-premises network of Litware contains the resources shown in the following table.
   <br/>
   <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04082/0007900001.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Network Environment -
   <br/>
   Litware has ExpressRoute connectivity to Azure.
   <br/>
   Planned Changes and Requirements
   <br/>
   Litware plans to implement the following changes:
   <br/>
   Migrate DB1 and DB2 to Azure.
   <br/>
   Migrate App1 to Azure virtual machines.
   <br/>
   Migrate the external storage used by App1 to Azure Storage.
   <br/>
   Deploy the Azure virtual machines that will host App1 to Azure dedicated hosts.
   <br/>
   Authentication and Authorization Requirements
   <br/>
   Litware identifies the following authentication and authorization requirements:
   <br/>
   Only users that manage the production environment by using the Azure portal must connect from a
                    hybrid Azure AD-joined device and authenticate by using
   <br/>
   Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
   <br/>
   The Network Contributor built-in RBAC role must be used to grant permissions to the network
                    administrators for all the virtual networks in all the Azure subscriptions.
   <br/>
   To access the resources in Azure, App1 must use the managed identity of the virtual machines that
                    will host the app.
   <br/>
   <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04082/0007900008.png"/>
   <br/>
   RBAC roles must be applied at the highest level possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Resiliency Requirements -
   <br/>
   Litware identifies the following resiliency requirements:
   <br/>
   Once migrated to Azure, DB1 and DB2 must meet the following requirements:
   <br/>
   - Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail.
   <br/>
   - Fail over automatically.
   <br/>
   - Minimize I/O latency.
   <br/>
   App1 must meet the following requirements:
   <br/>
   - Be hosted in an Azure region that supports availability zones.
   <br/>
   - Be hosted on Azure virtual machines that support automatic scaling.
   <br/>
   - Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail.
   <br/>
   Security and Compliance Requirements
   <br/>
   Litware identifies the following security and compliance requirements:
   <br/>
   Once App1 is migrated to Azure, you must ensure that new data can be written to the app, and the
                    modification of new and existing data is prevented for a period of three years.
   <br/>
   On-premises users and services must be able to access the Azure Storage account that will host the
                    data in App1.
   <br/>
   Access to the public endpoint of the Azure Storage account that will host the App1 data must be
                    prevented.
   <br/>
   All Azure SQL databases in the production environment must have Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
                    enabled.
   <br/>
   App1 must NOT share physical hardware with other workloads.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Business Requirements -
   <br/>
   Litware identifies the following business requirements:
   <br/>
   Minimize administrative effort.
   <br/>
   Minimize costs.

   You need to implement the Azure RBAC role assignments for the Network Contributor role. The solution
                    must meet the authentication and authorization requirements.
   <br/>
   What is the minimum number of assignments that you must use?
