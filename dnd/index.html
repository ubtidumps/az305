   You have an Azure subscription. The subscription contains Azure virtual machines that run Windows
                    Server 2016 and Linux.
   <br/>
   You need to use Azure Monitor to design an alerting strategy for security-related events.
   <br/>
   Which Azure Monitor Logs tables should you query? To answer, drag the appropriate tables to the
                    correct log types. Each table may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag
                    the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.

    Introductory Info
   </span>
   Case Study -
   <br/>
   This is a case study. Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you
                    would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this
                    exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on
                    this exam in the time provided.
   <br/>
   To answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is
                    provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide
                    more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is
                    independent of the other questions in this case study.
   <br/>
   At the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your
                    answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new
                    section, you cannot return to this section.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   To start the case study -
   <br/>
   To display the first question in this case study, click the Next button. Use the buttons in the left
                    pane to explore the content of the case study before you answer the questions. Clicking these
                    buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem
                    statements. If the case study has an All Information tab, note that the information displayed is
                    identical to the information displayed on the subsequent tabs. When you are ready to answer a
                    question, click the Question button to return to the question.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment: Technical Environment
   <br/>
   The on-premises network contains a single Active Directory domain named contoso.com.
   <br/>
   Contoso has a single Azure subscription.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment: Business Partnerships
   <br/>
   Contoso has a business partnership with Fabrikam, Inc. Fabrikam users access some Contoso
                    applications over the internet by using Azure Active Directory
   <br/>
   (Azure AD) guest accounts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Requirements: Planned Changes -
   <br/>
   Contoso plans to deploy two applications named App1 and App2 to Azure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Requirements: App1 -
   <br/>
   App1 will be a Python web app hosted in Azure App Service that requires a Linux runtime. Users from
                    Contoso and Fabrikam will access App1.
   <br/>
   App1 will access several services that require third-party credentials and access strings. The
                    credentials and access strings are stored in Azure Key Vault.
   <br/>
   App1 will have six instances: three in the East US Azure region and three in the West Europe Azure
                    region.
   <br/>
   App1 has the following data requirements:
   <br/>
   Each instance will write data to a data store in the same availability zone as the instance.
   <br/>
   Data written by any App1 instance must be visible to all App1 instances.
   <br/>
   App1 will only be accessible from the internet. App1 has the following connection requirements:
   <br/>
   Connections to App1 must pass through a web application firewall (WAF).
   <br/>
   Connections to App1 must be active-active load balanced between instances.
   <br/>
   All connections to App1 from North America must be directed to the East US region. All other
                    connections must be directed to the West Europe region.
   <br/>
   Every hour, you will run a maintenance task by invoking a PowerShell script that copies files from
                    all the App1 instances. The PowerShell script will run from a central location.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Requirements: App2 -
   <br/>
   App2 will be a NET app hosted in App Service that requires a Windows runtime. App2 has the following
                    file storage requirements:
   <br/>
   Save files to an Azure Storage account.
   <br/>
   Replicate files to an on-premises location.
   <br/>
   Ensure that on-premises clients can read the files over the LAN by using the SMB protocol.
   <br/>
   You need to monitor App2 to analyze how long it takes to perform different transactions within the
                    application. The solution must not require changes to the application code.
   <br/>
   Application Development Requirements
   <br/>
   Application developers will constantly develop new versions of App1 and App2. The development
                    process must meet the following requirements:
   <br/>
   A staging instance of a new application version must be deployed to the application host before the
                    new version is used in production.
   <br/>
   After testing the new version, the staging version of the application will replace the production
                    version.
   <br/>
   The switch to the new application version from staging to production must occur without any downtime
                    of the application.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Identity Requirements -
   <br/>
   Contoso identifies the following requirements for managing Fabrikam access to resources:
   <br/>
   Every month, an account manager at Fabrikam must review which Fabrikam users have access permissions
                    to App1. Accounts that no longer need permissions must be removed as guests.
   <br/>
   The solution must minimize development effort.
   <br/>
   <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04082/0003200013.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Security Requirement -
   <br/>
   All secrets used by Azure services must be stored in Azure Key Vault.
   <br/>
   Services that require credentials must have the credentials tied to the service instance. The
                    credentials must NOT be shared between services.
   <span class="inquestion-subtitle mb-0 mt-3">
    Question
   </span>
   DRAG DROP -
   <br/>
   You need to recommend a solution that meets the file storage requirements for App2.
   <br/>
   What should you deploy to the Azure subscription and the on-premises network? To answer, drag the
                    appropriate services to the correct locations. Each service may be used once, more than once, or not
                    at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.

    Box 1: Azure Files -
    <br/>
    Scenario: App2 has the following file storage requirements:
    <br/>
    ✑ Save files to an Azure Storage account.
    <br/>
    ✑ Replicate files to an on-premises location.
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    Box 2: Azure File Sync -
    <br/>
    Use Azure File Sync to centralize your organization's file shares in Azure Files, while keeping
                        the flexibility, performance, and compatibility of an on-premises file server. Azure File Sync
                        transforms Windows Server into a quick cache of your Azure file share. You can use any protocol
                        that's available on Windows Server to access your data locally, including SMB, NFS, and FTPS.
                        You can have as many caches as you need across the world.
